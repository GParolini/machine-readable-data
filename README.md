# machine-readable-data
This repository hosts a **Guide on machine-readable data formats for biodiversity science**. Alongside the Guide, the GitHub repository also includes a **glossary** defining key terms used in the Guide, such as *data format* and *data standard*, and a quick reference **list of open data formats** divided according to data type (tabular, geographic, etc.).

The Guide on machine-readable data formats is complemented by a **Jupyter notebook with examples**. The notebook and related data are in a separate folder in this repository. It is recommended to go through the examples while reading the Guide, as the cases selected give a clear illustration of the statements made.

If you wish to improve this repository or you have comments and suggestions, you are welcome to create an issue in GitHub or make a Pull request.
