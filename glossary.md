### <a id="data">Data</a> 
According to [ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023, 3.2.23](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:11179:-1:ed-4:v1:en) data are a "reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation or processing". Data processing can be a task for both humans and machines.
<br/>

### <a id="format">Data format</a> 
The notion of data format can be defined in different ways. For the scope of the Guide "Machine Readable Data Formats in Biodiversity Informatics", the definition of data format followed is the definition provided [here](https://resources.data.gov/standards/concepts/), i.e., a data format is the syntax, encoding, and file format or media type used for storing and transmitting data. Under this definition, both specifications for JSON serialisation for data storage and transmission and a JSON data file (.json) that implement JSON serialisation are part of the JSON data format.
<br/>

### <a id="standard">Data standard</a>  
Technical specification, for instance, an ISO standard like [ISO 19136-1:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/75676.html) that defines the Geographic Markup Language (GML). A data standard describes how data should be stored and exchanged for achieving consistency and interoperability across different systems, sources, and users ([here](https://resources.data.gov/standards/concepts/)). As such, a data standard can include information on data formats that implement the standard specifications.
<br/>

### <a id="open">Open data format</a>  
The [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://opendefinition.org/ofd/#:~:text=An%20Open%20Data%20Format%20is,can%20be%20implemented%20by%20others) defines an open data format as "a format with a freely available published specification which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use”. One example of a open data format is JSON, whose specification is freely available on the web. Anyone using this specification can develop software tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in JSON format and does not need to pay any licensing fee to implement these tools. Some formats can be considered open because they are royalty-free, but require a one-time fee to access the specification.
It is important to stress that the concept of open data format has nothing to do with the concept of machine-readable data format. For instance, PDF is an open data format, but it is not a machine-readable data format. Of course, there are data formats, like JSON, that are both open and machine-readable.
<br/>

### <a id="proprietary">Proprietary data format</a> 
A proprietary data format requires royalty-based software to be used. In a few cases, specifications for proprietary data formats (e.g., Microsoft Office files, ESRI shapefiles) have been made available to promote interoperability.
